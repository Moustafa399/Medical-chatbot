# Medical-chatbot
Overview
This project is a Medical Chatbot powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), designed to assist users with basic medical inquiries. The chatbot can understand and respond to health-related questions by analyzing user input and providing relevant information.

Key Features
âœ… NLP-Based Understanding â€“ Uses intent-based classification to interpret user queries.
âœ… Predefined Intents Dataset â€“ Trained on a structured intent dataset containing medical-related topics.
âœ… Deep Learning Model â€“ Utilizes neural networks for text classification and response generation.
âœ… Interactive Chat Interface â€“ Provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ Python â€“ Core programming language
ðŸ”¹ JSON Dataset (Intents) â€“ Used for chatbot training

Project Workflow
âœ… Data Preparation â€“ Collected medical-related intents dataset. Model Training â€“ Built and trained a deep learning model for intent classification.
âœ… Chatbot Integration â€“ Developed a Flask-based API for interaction.
âœ… Testing & Deployment â€“ Evaluated chatbot responses and deployed as a web service.
